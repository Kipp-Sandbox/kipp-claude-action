# Claude Code Action

> [!NOTE] > **This is a fork of [anthropics/claude-code-action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action).**
> Custom commits are rebased on top of upstream via a `sync-upstream` workflow.

## Fork Changes

### Slash Commands

- **Multi-slash-command support** -- Both tag mode and agent mode can run multiple slash commands from a single invocation (e.g. `/maintain deps auto` then `/ship auto`). Commands execute sequentially, stop on first failure, and resume the prior session so Claude retains full conversation context across commands.
- **Slash command detection in agent mode** -- Agent mode writes a separate `claude-user-request.txt` file, enabling the SDK's multi-block message path so slash commands work in automation workflows.

### Event and Auth Extensions

- **Push event support** -- Adds `push` to the set of recognised automation event types, allowing the action to trigger on push events.
- **Automation event token handling** -- Push and schedule events short-circuit token setup and return the default workflow token immediately instead of attempting OIDC exchange.
- **Azure Foundry API key support** -- Passes through `ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_API_KEY` for Azure AI Foundry authentication via API key (no OIDC required).

### Fork Maintenance

- **Upstream sync workflow** -- Manual `sync-upstream` workflow fetches upstream, identifies custom-only commits via patch-id comparison (dropping duplicates), cherry-picks them onto upstream, and force-pushes. Creates a backup branch before each sync for rollback safety. When a cherry-pick conflicts, the workflow installs Claude Code CLI and invokes Claude (via Azure AI Foundry) to resolve the conflict automatically. If Claude cannot resolve a conflict, the workflow fails and the backup branch remains for manual recovery.
- **Upstream workflow removal** -- All upstream CI/release/test workflows are removed. The sync workflow automatically strips any new workflow files introduced by upstream.

A general-purpose [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) action for GitHub PRs and issues that can answer questions and implement code changes. This action intelligently detects when to activate based on your workflow context—whether responding to @claude mentions, issue assignments, or executing automation tasks with explicit prompts. It supports multiple authentication methods including Anthropic direct API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and Microsoft Foundry.

## Features

- 🎯 **Intelligent Mode Detection**: Automatically selects the appropriate execution mode based on your workflow context—no configuration needed
- 🤖 **Interactive Code Assistant**: Claude can answer questions about code, architecture, and programming
- 🔍 **Code Review**: Analyzes PR changes and suggests improvements
- ✨ **Code Implementation**: Can implement simple fixes, refactoring, and even new features
- 💬 **PR/Issue Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitHub comments and PR reviews
- 🛠️ **Flexible Tool Access**: Access to GitHub APIs and file operations (additional tools can be enabled via configuration)
- 📋 **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators with checkboxes that dynamically update as Claude completes tasks
- 📊 **Structured Outputs**: Get validated JSON results that automatically become GitHub Action outputs for complex automations
- 🏃 **Runs on Your Infrastructure**: The action executes entirely on your own GitHub runner (Anthropic API calls go to your chosen provider)
- ⚙️ **Simplified Configuration**: Unified `prompt` and `claude_args` inputs provide clean, powerful configuration aligned with Claude Code SDK

## 📦 Upgrading from v0.x?

**See our [Migration Guide](./docs/migration-guide.md)** for step-by-step instructions on updating your workflows to v1.0. The new version simplifies configuration while maintaining compatibility with most existing setups.

## Quickstart

The easiest way to set up this action is through [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) in the terminal. Just open `claude` and run `/install-github-app`.

This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.

**Note**:

- You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
- This quickstart method is only available for direct Anthropic API users. For AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry setup, see [docs/cloud-providers.md](./docs/cloud-providers.md).
